# tcp-shutdown
 Minecraft plugin, which shuts down minecraft server if packet is sent to specified port

This plugin is made by AI and changed for my purposes.

When you add this plugin to the plugins folder, and then turn the server on, the plugin should add config.yaml inside plugins/tcp folder. There you can set port and the message which should turn the server off
